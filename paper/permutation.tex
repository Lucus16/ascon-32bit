\subsection{Permutation}

Ascon keeps an internal state of 320 bits. On 64-bit platforms, this is
usually kept in 5 registers, on 32-bit platforms, it needs to be kept in
10.

The core of Ascon consists of a transformation applies in several
rounds. Each round consists of three phases: The addition of the round
constant, the substitution layer and the linear diffusion layer.
