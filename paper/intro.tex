\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Ascon}

Ascon\cite{ascon} is an authenticated encryption cipher designed for use in
resource constrained environments, like embedded devices. It has an internal
state of just 320 bits, which can be kept in registers on most
microarchitectures. This ensures moving data between registers and memory is
kept to a minimum, which is important, as embedded devices usually don't have
the same amount of cache available as larger systems.
