<h1 id="optimizing-ascon-on-32-bits-architectures">Optimizing Ascon on 32-bits architectures</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m Lars Jellema, my supervisors are Peter Schwabe and Christoph Dobraunig. My thesis is about optimizing Ascon for 32-bits architectures, which is in the field of cryptographic engineering and optimization. Ascon is designed to run fast on 64-bits architectures. The purpose of this thesis is to show that Ascon is a good contender in the Caesar competition because it can even be made fast on 32-bits architectures. I will look at the three separate phases of the Ascon inner loop and try to optimize each one on a variety of 32-bits architectures, starting with RISC-V. I will then compare the different techniques that are effective on different architectures. I expect to be able to save only a few percent on RISC-V, compared to a trivial implementation, but potentially more on more complicated 32-bit architectures.</p>
